I am an M.A.Sc. (research-based master) student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. I previously completed my B.A.Sc. in the division of Engineering Science at the University of Toronto, graduating with honours.

I was born and raised in Shenyang, China.

Research
======
My research interests primarily lie in:
- Distributed Machine Learning, including:
  - Datacenter Network
  - Communication & Bandwidth Allocation for Deep Learning Training Optimization
- Large Language Model (LLM) Post-Training, including:
  - Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)
  - Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

I’m also interested in topics like Multimodal AI, Explainable AI, and Agentic RL (search/compile/code agent), and I’m eager to learn and explore related topics that can build more robust, interpretable, and aligned language models.
