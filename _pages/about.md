I am an M.A.Sc. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, supervised by Prof. Baochun Li. I previously completed my B.A.Sc. in the division of Engineering Science at the University of Toronto, graduating with honours.

I was born and raised in Shenyang, China.
